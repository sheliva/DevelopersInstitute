            Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands
            and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. <br />
            It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted
            adapts to being active at night and at twilight. <br />
            A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and
            cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult
            lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. <br />
            Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates,
            including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe
